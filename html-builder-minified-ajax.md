# Html Builder Minified Ajax

Ajax is an option that you set to tell `dataTable` where to fetch it's data. 
But unlike the regular ajax method, `minifiedAjax` minifies the url generated by dataTables by removing any unnecessary query parameters thus shortening the url
from approx 1500 url length down to 500. 
Shortening the URL will help us prevent any browser and development issues concerning the URL length exceeding the max allowed value.


**Syntax**
```php
$builder->minifiedAjax($url, $script = '', $data = []);
```

## Ajax Parameters
`$url` is the url where we will fetch our json data.

`$script` any vanilla javascript to be included on `data` method of ajax.

`$data` is an array of values to be appended on server request.


```php
$builder->minifiedAjax('', null, ['foo' => 'bar'])
```
